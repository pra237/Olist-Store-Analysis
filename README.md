# Olist Store Analysis Project

Welcome to the Olist Store Analysis project! This project aims to assess the performance of olist store by analyzing key metrics and evaluating various aspects of our operations. In this readme file, you will find an overview of the project, its objectives, and the key findings from analysis.

## About the Project

The primary goal of this project is to evaluate and improve store's sales performance. We achieve this by examining key metrics such as revenue growth, average transaction value, conversion rates, and customer retention. By analyzing these metrics, we can identify trends and patterns that will help us make informed decisions to drive our sales.

Another important aspect of the project is the evaluation of the impact of the store on customer experience and satisfaction. By understanding customer preferences, we can optimize our store's offerings to enhance the overall experience. This includes analyzing the different payment modes accepted by the store and identifying the preferred payment modes among our target audience.

Operational efficiency is also a focus of this project. Through the analysis of aspects such as inventory management, supply chain logistics, staff productivity, and cost control measures, we aim to streamline operations and reduce expenses. This helps us improve our overall efficiency and profitability.

Furthermore, the project evaluates the performance of the store across different cities or geographical locations. This analysis provides insights into customer behavior, preferences, and demands specific to each city, enabling us to customize our strategies and offerings accordingly.

2. Review Score and Payment Type Analysis:
   - Customers who pay with credit cards tend to leave higher review scores.
   - Credit card is the preferred payment method among customers.
   - Improving product quality can potentially increase customer review scores and, consequently, the number of orders.

3. Products and Shipping Days Analysis:
   - The average number of days to deliver orders for specific product categories varies.
   - Streamlining the supply chain and addressing any bottlenecks can improve delivery times and customer satisfaction.

4. Payment and Price Analysis:
   - Pricing strategies can influence customers' choice of payment methods.
   - Optimizing pricing structures and tailoring payment options can enhance customer satisfaction.

5. Review Score and Shipping Days Relationship:
